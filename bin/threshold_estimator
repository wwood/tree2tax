# Get a list of all the different families
# For each family, find the internal node

# For each genus, find the node
# Ensure that the genus is found within the family, otherwise don't consider it
# For each genus, find the tip that is farthest from the taxon label
# pairwise comparison of each genus in the family against each other - what is the maximal distance?
# print the maximal distance with the family information
